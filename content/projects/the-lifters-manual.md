![The Lifter's Manual](/images/tlm.jpg "The Lifter's Manual")

The Lifter's Manual is a Kindle book I wrote to summarize everything I had learned about lifting weights from my degree, years of coaching clients, and (at the time) ten years of training myself. It is essentially what I wish I could give my 15 year old self.

It is available on Amazon [here](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lifters-Manual-Build-Always-Wanted-ebook/dp/B01N9XKVVB/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&qid=1590253142&refinements=p_27%3AEddie+Summers&s=digital-text&sr=1-1&text=Eddie+Summers).
