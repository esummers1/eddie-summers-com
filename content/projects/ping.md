Ping is an homage to the classic arcade game Pong, with some liberties taken on physics. It appears similar to the original, with two white rectangles for paddles and a white square for a ball.

The player controls the left paddle, and a rudimentary AI controls the right paddle. The paddle will accelerate and decelerate with a feeling of some weight, rather than just moving up and down linearly. The ball gains speed on each paddle impact, forcing one side to eventually make a mistake. Collisions are implemented by hand, and work most of the time.

Ping is written in Java and uses Swing for the UI.
