These are books that I have found particularly helpful for things like organizing myself or projects, time management, or thinking better about my work.

## Career Advice

### [So Good They Can't Ignore You](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13525945-so-good-they-can-t-ignore-you?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=DXhTt0T0Ju&rank=1) by Cal Newport

It was partly because of this book that I chose software engineering to begin with - Newport's lucid, logical argument guides you through why he thinks skills trump everything else, and the ways he thinks people can most reliably build careers they love. These assertions are backed up with plenty of case studies of successful and happy people.

## Productivity

### [Deep Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=yC6ZTWoLls&rank=1) by Cal Newport

This is an excellent book on the value of working deeply, i.e. without interruption, and strategies for getting more of it done. This goes nicely with *So Good They Can't Ignore You*, since this kind of work is the best way to build up the skills that the latter celebrates.

## Psychology

### [Thinking Fast and Slow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=HN6Vr7dgNs&rank=1) by Daniel Kahneman

This is a classic book by one of the founders of the field of behavioural economics, which explains in great detail the evidence for the various biases and failures in our ability to make rational decisions. If you pay attention, you will be able to notice these things about yourself, and work to make better decisions about things.
