*Opening squat at the Junior British Classic in 2015*

I write articles on this blog about some of my interests - usually productivity, software engineering, or fitness. The latter two are things I've done professionally, and the first is something I try to do.

I've been a software engineer for {{< years_since 1523228400 >}} years. I have an MSc in Computer Science from the University of Bath that I did part-time during the first few years of my career, and I work for [Beacon](https://beacon.com/) in London. I work across the whole stack, although I tend to find myself doing more backend work than frontend.

Before getting into programming, I used to work as a personal trainer - my undergraduate degree was in Sport & Exercise Science, also at Bath. In my spare time I enjoy powerlifting, gaming, reading and working on my own software projects.
