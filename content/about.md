*Opening squat at the Junior British Classic in 2015*

I work as a software engineer for [Duco](https://du.co/) in London. At the moment I'm studying for an MSc in Computer Science with the University of Bath via distance learning. Before getting into programming, I used to work as a personal trainer - my undergraduate degree was in Sport & Exercise Science, also at Bath. In my spare time I enjoy powerlifting, gaming, reading and working on my own software projects.
